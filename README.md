# zlib-shell-config
An npm package to auto install a bash shell config. This is my favorite bash config that 
uses oh-my-bash to display the shell terminal and add completions and other goodies. 

Feel free to try it out :)

# Install

Go to your home directory and

(Notice no `-g` or `sudo`)

### Github master version

```shell
